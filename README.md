Project completed  in Colorado School of Mines course CSCI 471:Computer Networks

# Project 2: DNS Resolution
Developing my own version of the DNS tool dig, called dug. 
## Part 1: Perfrom a simply query
The program will need to:
	- build the query packet
	[ We will stick to the original described in 1043 and 1035, you don't need to worry about any of the newer revisions.]
	- send it to the nameserver vai a UDP packet

Sending the request:
	- Build the DNS message
	
	- Send DNS messges as the body of a UDP request
